                  <p> Through this work experience I was taught the importance of customer service, working with an organized group and how to actively
                    cooperate and communicate with others. I was also able to learn how to use a variety of different tools and equipment that are used in primarily
                    landscaping and construction. Through these different tools I was able to better understand how to tackle new information and ideas to make them effective
                    and efficient as quickly as possible.

                    As explained from my Resume, I have had a great amount of experience working with groups and currently strive to better understand computer programing
                    and any programming languages presented to me. Although there is not extensive information covering my background of programming or a wealth of completed projects completed I have 
                    been able to work on a few projects that I am proud of. In addition I have allocated a lot of time to learning about different programming 
                    languages and methodologies for future use and am always looking forward to learning another technique. Over my years in college I have learned
                    a great deal about both Python and C++ with this very website being my first attempt at using HTML and CSS. So despite my seemingly lacking history
                    in programming I am confident that I will be able to learn any new language or technique that is required of me. Finally, I am always looking to complete
                    group activities and attend social events for those infatuated with computer programming like I am so working in a group or individually work just as well
                    for me.
