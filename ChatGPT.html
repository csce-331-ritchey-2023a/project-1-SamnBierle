      <h2>How to use ChatGPT</h2>
      <p>ChatGPT is a large language model that can answer questions and complete various tasks based on its training data. To use ChatGPT, simply ask it a question or provide it with a prompt and it will generate a response. It is important to be as specific as possible with your request to get the best results. </p>
      <h3>Proposed Command</h3>
      <p>Make an html page including a header and footer container, both light blue, and have instructions on how to use ChatGPT in the main section. Underneath this include 4 buttons within the footer section of the page, the first button leads to "Home.html" and is titled "Home", the second button leads to "Projects.html" and is titled "Projects", the third button leads to "Activity.html" and is titled "Activity" and the fourth button leads to "Resume.html" and is titled "Resume"</p>
